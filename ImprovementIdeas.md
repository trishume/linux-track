# Introduction #

On this page I'd like to discuss ideas for improvement and future development of the Linuxtrack software. If you have such an idea, please chime in, it will help me to make Linuxtrack better.

# Ideas #
In no particular order:

  * **Virtual mouse for MacOS X There are few hurdles** Especially catching a hotkeys for centering and start/stop; clean method is virtually opposite of straightforward and involves having a developer ID, which is way too expensive for me (given that Linuxtrack is free). Not so clean method is much more straghtforward, but involves some terminal commands (not very user firendly). There might be another way using services, but I need to investigate it further.

  * **Adding client solutions for other Linux/MacOS X games/programs** FTL, ETS2, you name it... Actually if you know of a candidate, please chime in and I'll see what I can do...

  * **Adding interfaces for other tracking devices** If you know of another headtracking device, please let me know and I'll see what I can do...

  * **Webcam features control for MacOS X** As MacOS doesn't provide any means to control settings of the webcam (exposure, brightness, gain, autoexposure), the tracking doesn't perform as well as it could, especially in terms of framerate.
