Linuxtrack - wine bridge
------------------------
At the moment this is only experimental thing, so no autotools support is available.
To compile the package, following prerequisities must be met:
 - Wine installed, along with development files (winegcc/wineg++ available)
 - libmxml installed for dumper (not mandatory)
 - linuxtrack must be built first
 - Nullsoft installator compiler (makensis available)

Just run 'make' in the wine_bridge directory and if all goes well, linuxtrack-wine.exe is created.
This executable is to be run in wine and it will install the linuxtrack support in the wine.

Make sure to install it in each of the wine "prefixes" you need the linuxtrack support in.

Dumper is to be used to dump new application data; go to the NaturalPoint site, and look for Game Updates.
Download the latest update and unpack it somewhere. Then take the sgl.dat contained in the archive, 
copy it next to the dumper and run dumper using 'dumper sgl.dat > data.txt'(no need for wine there, it is native 
linux app). Resulting file data.txt is to be copied in the linuxtrack support directory.

Controller allows you to controll the tracking using keyboard (no joystick support); just run it, select keys 
to controll the actions (press button, then a key). No Ctrl/Shift/Alt is taken into account - the first 
key to be pressed is used.

Tester is used to check how the link works. Write an application number (from data.txt) and after 
pressing start, the link is activated and you should see the numbers moving...
