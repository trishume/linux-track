The second step to take is to select the "model" to use. Model is a "marker", attached to ones head,
simplifying the head pose determination.

<p>
There are three predefined models "NP TrackClip", "NP TrackClip Pro" and "Face" (you have to select a 
webcam with 'face tracker' suffix in the device pane to use it) - if you use one of those,
just select it using the <b>Model Name</b> combobox.

<p>
<h1>Model Creation</h1>
If you use any other model, you'll have to create it first. Just press the <b>Create New</b> button
and the form for new model creation will pop up.

<p>
Type in the name of your model to the <b>Model Name</b> box and then select the model type. 
Available model types are these:
 <ul>
   <li><b>1 point</b> - single LED diode or reflective marker; simple but gives you only 2 degrees of freedom 
            (rotate view verticaly and horizontaly)</li>
   <li><b>3 point Cap</b> - three LEDs or reflective markers, for example on the top of your cap; 
       provides 6 degrees of freedom</li>
   <li><b>3 point Clip</b> - three LEDs or reflective markers, for example on the side of your headset;
       provides 6 degrees of freedom</li>
   <li><b>Face</b> - used for face tracking; provides 3 degrees of freedom (rotate view verticaly and 
                     horizontaly, movement back and forth)</li>
 </ul>

<p>
Now fill in the model dimensions (where applicable) according to the diagram (all dimensions are in milimeters).
Last thing to do is to select, if the model uses LEDs - if it does, check the <b>Model with LEDs</b> checkbox.
After pressing the <b>Create</b> button, the new model should appear 
in the <b>Model Name</b> combobox for you to select it.

<h1>Model Tweaking</h1>
To minimize unwanted view movement while panning, you can tweak the 3-point Clip 
and 3-point Cap model.
Note however, that the movement can't be fully suppressed, both due to the
head movement model simplification (assuming that all panning is done using a single
joint) and also due to the human's inability to stand absolutely still while turning
the head.  Note also that turning the head inherently contains some movement - for 
example look down and realize that your viewpoint shifted forward and down...

<h2>Model tweaking procedure</h2>
Both three point model types share the same system of tweaking - there are several
sliders, that allow you to adjust the model center-point and minimize the unwanted 
movement.

To see the particular movement precisely, go to the <b>Tracking setup</b> tab, open the 
<b>Detailed axes setup dialog</b> and select the axis of your interest. 
Observe the horizontal movement of the cross in the axis visualization area, that represents 
computed head movement or angle.
<p>
For example, the first slider in the 3 point Clip model tweaking pannel allows you to minimize the
back and forth head movement while looking left and right.
To find the "sweet spot", employ the "halving of the interval" method,
utilizing the fact, that at that point the movement is smallest and its direction reverses.
<p>
Move the slider to the left extreme and observe the Z axis, while panning
left and right - note the direction of the movement of the cross; for example,
when looking left, the cross moves right and vice versa.
Now move the slider fully to the right and see that the response is reversed 
(e.g. look left, move left). 
<p>
The spot you are looking for is somewhere in between the two. Move the slider 
to the middle and see what the response is in there; for example the look left
moves the cross to the right - which is the same direction as the leftmost
slider extreme. That means, that the sweet spot lies in the second half 
of the interval (in this example). Now you can continue by repeating the halving,
or just try moving the slider around in small increments to minimize the movement. 
<p>
Repeat the above steps for both (3-point Cap)/all three (3-point Clip) sliders to reduce the amount
of the unwanted movements; if the result doesn't satisfy you, you can remove the rest of it by
increasing the deadzone for the axis of interest.
