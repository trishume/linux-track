<h2><A name="XplInstall">Xplane plugin installation</A></h2>
This button installs the XPlane plugin. When pressed, a dialogue appears, asking you to browse 
to your XPlane executable. 
<img src="XplInstall.png" width="100%" alt=""><br>
When there, select the executable and press the <b>Open</b> button.
<img src="XplBrowse.png" width="100%" alt=""><br>
Shoud a problem occur, a message would be shown, otherwise you can close ltr_gui and start XPlane.
<p>
In case you use several XPlane installations, install the plugin into each of them.
<p>
For details on the XPlane plugin setup refer to the <a href="xpl_setup.htm">Xplane plugin setup page.</a>

<h2>Linuxtrack-Wine support installation</h2>
To utilize Linuxtrack under Wine, two conditions must be satisfied: a TrackIR firmware with companion files
must be available (even if you aren't using the TrackIR for tracking) and Linuxtrack-Wine "plugin" must be 
installed in each "bottle"/Wine prefix, where a program/game requiring headtracking is installed.
<p>
When the <b>Linuxtrack-Wine support files install</b> button is pressed, a check is performed to ensure the
required files are present and if necessary a dialogue facilitating the TrackIR firmware extraction pops up - 
just follow the instructions and install the firmware.
<p>
On Linux, a dialogue asking for the target "Wine prefix" (or "bottle") pops up - the Linuxtrack-Wine 
will be installed there.
<p>
On MacOS X, the linuxtrack-wine.exe installer (located in the Linuxtrack .dmg package) must be 
installed manually - just run the installer in the desired "bottle".

<p>
Several applications are installed - <b>Controller</b> (allows you to pause and recenter tracking by a keypress), 
<b>Tester</b> (troubleshooting aid to test the tracking) and Uninstall (allowing you to remove Linuxtrack-Wine).
<p>
When a <b>Controller</b> is started, window pops up and you should specify the pause key and recenter key - 
just press the appropriate button followed by key/keys of your choice (max 2 keys). 
<p>
While the <b>Controller</b> is running(it can be minimized to tray), start the program/game and the tracking should 
just work.
<p>
When using more prefixes/bottles, always make sure to install the plugin into all of them and also make 
sure you use the Controller from the same prefix/bottle as the current target game/program, 
otherwise you'll not be able to controll the Linuxtrack!

<h2>Logfile viewer</h2>
Press the button to see the contents of ltr_gui's log - it might contain some interesting informations 
especially when debugging a problem.

<h2>Package Logs</h2>
This button creates zip file containing Linuxtrack logs, which is handy when reporting a problem.

<h2>Troubleshooting options</h2>
There are several checkboxes allowing you to modify Linuxtrack's behavior when needed...
<ul>
<li><b>Disable camera view</b> disables camera view in the Tracking window.</li>
<li><b>Disable 3D tracking preview</b> disables 3D preview in the Tracking window; this might be
  handy especially on machines with weak GPU (gma950 and similar), where it considerably lowers
  the machine load.</li>
<li><b>Use legacy pose computation method</b> - not to be checked unless directly asked by a
  developer.</li>
<li><b>Use legacy rotation computation method</b> - not to be checked unless directly asked by a
  developer.</li>
<li><b>Disable translation/rotation alignment</b> allows you to decouple rotations and translations.
  Normally translations are aligned with in-game view - when you rotate your in-game head to look
  out of the side window and move your head towards the screen, the view moves towards the window. If this
  behavior is not desired, check the button and the effect will be disabled.</li>
</ul>
