The last pane contains things that didn't fit into the other panes. 

<h2>Xplane plugin installation</h2>
This button installs the XPlane plugin. When pressed, a dialog appears asking you to browse 
to your XPlane executable. When there, select the executable and press button <b>Open</b>.
In case of problem, a message is shown, otherwise you can close ltr_gui and start XPlane.
<p>
In case you use several XPlane installations, install the plugin into each of them.
<p>
For details on the XPlane plugin setup see 
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/linux-track/wiki/XplanePluginSetup">Xplane plugin setup page.</a>

<h2>Wine plugin installation</h2>
This button lets you install the linuxtrack-wine bridge. It allows TrackIR enabled games in wine 
to utilize linuxtrack.
<p>
When you press the button, you'll be asked to go to the "wine prefix" (or bottle on Mac) 
of your choice. If you are unsure what I'm talking about, just press enter and the default 
one is used. An installator shows up - follow the instructions and when done, start the Controller.

<p>
Controller window shows and you should specify pause key and recenter key - just press the appropriate button
followed by key/keys of your choice (max 2 keys). These keys will be used ingame to pause the tracker (e.g. 
when playing with avionics).
<p>
When the controller is running, start the program/game and the tracking should just work!
<p>
When using more prefixes, always make sure to install the plugin into all of them and also make 
sure you use the Controller from the same prefix, otherwise you'll not be able to controll the 
linuxtrack!

<h2>Logfile viewer</h2>
Press the button to see the ltr_gui log - can contain some interesting informations when debuggin a problem.

<h2>Package Logs</h2>
This button creates zip file containing Linuxtrack logs, which is handy when reporting a problem.

<h2>Troubleshooting options</h2>
There are several checkboxes allowing you to modify Linuxtrack behavior when needed...
<ul>
<li><b>Disable camera view</b> disables camera view in the Tracking window.</li>
<li><b>Disable 3D tracking preview</b> disables 3D preview in the Tracking window; this might be
  handy especially on machines with weak GPU (gma950 and similar), where it considerably lowers
  the machine load.</li>
<li><b>Use legacy pose computation method</b> - not to be checked unless directly asked by 
  developer.</li>
<li><b>Use legacy rotation computation method</b> - not to be checked unless directly asked by 
  developer.</li>
<li><b>Disable translation/rotation alignment</b> allows you to decouple rotations and translations.
  Normally translations are aligned with in-game view - when you rotate your in-game head to look
  out of the side window and move towards the screen, the view moves towards the window. If this
  behavior is not desired, check the button and the effect will be disabled.</li>
</ul>
