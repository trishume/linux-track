<h2><A name="XplInstall">X-Plane plug-in installation</A></h2>
This button installs the X-Plane plug-in. When pressed, a dialogue appears, asking you to browse
to your X-Plane executable.

When there, select the executable and press the <b>Open</b> button.

Should a problem occur, a message would be shown, otherwise you can close ltr_gui and start X-Plane.
<p>
In case you use several X-Plane installations, install the plug-in into each of them.
<p>
For details on the X-Plane plug-in setup refer to the <a href="xpl_setup.htm">X-Plane plug-in setup page.</a>

<h2>Linuxtrack-Wine support installation</h2>
For more info see <a href="wine.htm">here</a>.

<h2>Log-file viewer</h2>
Press the button to see the contents of ltr_gui's log - it might contain some interesting informations
especially when debugging a problem.

<h2>Package Logs</h2>
This button creates zip file containing Linuxtrack logs, which is handy when reporting a problem.

<h2>Troubleshooting options</h2>
There are several check-boxes allowing you to modify Linuxtrack's behavior when needed...
<ul>
<li><b>Disable camera view</b> disables camera view in the Tracking window.</li>
<li><b>Disable 3D tracking preview</b> disables 3D preview in the Tracking window; this might be
  handy especially on machines with weak GPU (gma950 and similar), where it considerably lowers
  the machine load.</li>
<li><b>Use legacy pose computation method</b> - not to be checked unless directly asked by a
  developer.</li>
<li><b>Use legacy rotation computation method</b> - not to be checked unless directly asked by a
  developer.</li>
<li><b>Disable translation/rotation alignment</b> allows you to decouple rotations and translations.
  Normally translations are aligned with in-game view - when you rotate your in-game head to look
  out of the side window and move your head towards the screen, the view moves towards the window. If this
  behavior is not desired, check the button and the effect will be disabled.</li>
</ul>
