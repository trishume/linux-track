<h1>Miscelaneous</h1>
The last pane contains things that didn't fit into the other panes. 

<h2>Xplane plugin installation</h2>
This button installs the XPlane plugin. When pressed, a dialog appears asking you to browse to your XPlane
executable. When there, select the executable and press button <b>Open</b>.
In case of problem, a message is shown, otherwise you can close ltr_gui and start XPlane.
<p>
In case you use several XPlane installations, install the plugin into each of them.
<p>
The plugin is itself a link, which brings these two effects:
<ul>
<li>When you update linuxtrack, the plugin is updated too (provided you don't relocate the linuxtrack)...</li>
<li>Whenever you move linuxtrack to a different directory, you have to reinstall the plugin!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wine plugin installation</h2>
This button lets you install the linuxtrack-wine bridge. It allows TrackIR enabled games in wine to utilize
linuxtrack.
<p>
When you press the button, you'll be asked to go to the "wine prefix" (or bottle on Mac) of your choice.
If you are unsure what I'm talking about, just press enter and the default one is used.
An installator shows up - follow the instructions and when done, start the Controller.

<p>
Controller window shows and you should specify pause key and recenter key - just press the appropriate button
followed by key/keys of your choice (max 2 keys). These keys will be used ingame to pause the tracker (e.g. 
when playing with avionics).
<p>
When the controller is running, start the program/game and the tracking should work!
<p>
When using more prefixes, always make sure to install the plugin into all of them and also make sure you use
Controller from the same prefix, otherwise you'll not be able to controll the linuxtrack!

<h2>Logfile viewer</h2>
Press the button to see the ltr_gui log - can contain some interesting informations when debuggin a problem.

<h2>Disable camera and 3D tracking preview</h2>
These checkboxes allow you to deactivate the corresponding panes of <b>Tracking window</b>.
Especially the second one might get handy on machines with weak GPU (gma950 and so on) - when deactivated 
the machine load goes down considerably.

<h2>Legacy pose computation method</h2>
You should never need this - use it only when directly asked by linuxtrack team member.
It reenables old pose computation method - weak perspective method based on Alter's article from '92.
