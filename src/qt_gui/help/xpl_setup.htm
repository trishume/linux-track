<h1>XPlane plugin setup</h1>
You have installed the XPlane plugin according to the <A href="misc.htm#XplInstall">Xplane plugin installation</A>
To use it in XPlane, keys or joystick buttons have to be bound in order to start, stop, recenter and pause the
tracking. Please note, that setup of tracking parameters (sensitivities, ...) is done in the linuxtrack GUI, 
XPlane plugin doesn't have any means to do that.

<h1>Joystick buttons setup</h1>
Joystick buttons are setup using Buttons : Adv pane in the Joystick & Equipment window, that is accesible 
through Settings / Joystick, Keys & Equipment menu.

Press the desired joystick button, and then check the checkbox next to the tabs (under the mouse pointer 
in the screenshot above). Following dialog will appear.

Click the combobox in the upper part of the dialog and select X System folder.

Select the linuxtrack line in the lower part of the dialog.

Finally select the desired command (ltr_run, ltr_pause or ltr_recenter).

Repeat those steps and when done, just close the window and now you can controll Linuxtrack using new bindings.



<h1>Keyboard bindings setup</h1>

Keyboard bindings are setup pretty much in the same way - use Keys pane in the Joystick & Equipment window, 
that is accessible through Settings / Joystick, Keys & Equipment menu.

When you create or select a key binding, use the checkbox next to the tabs and continue the same way as above.
<p>
You can also press Add new key assignment button in the middle bottom, that will create new key position - 
just press the newly created button and then press the key (or key combination) that you want to assign to it. 
Then again select the desired binding.

<h1>PilotView interface</h1>

Recent Linuxtrack versions contain an interface, allowing Linuxtrack's XPlane plugin to communicate with 
PilotView plugin(version 1.7+) by Sandy Barbour.
<p>
To enable the PilotView interface, open the PilotView.ini file (located in Resources/plugins/PilotView 
directory in your XPlane installation folder) in your favorite text editor and add a 
line "EnableExternalData = 1" to the CONFIG section, so the result reads like this:

<p><b>
[CONFIG]<br>
EnableExternalData = 1<br>
AutoStart = 0<br>
EngineVibration = 1<br>
...<br>
</b></p>
<p>
When done, start XPlane and start the tracking - now, when PilotView plugin is enabled, the tracking should work.

<h2>Troubleshooting PilotView interface</h2>

Should you encounter any problems, please follow these steps:
<ul>
    <li>Verify you have PilotView 1.7 or higher (see the titlebar of its Config window)</li>
    <li>If you installed PilotView plugin before May 19th 2013, please download the fresh version and try 
    again (don't forget the required modification of the .ini file!)</li>
    <li>If you didn't reinstalled the Linuxtrack plugin, please do so in the ltr_gui (Misc. pane)</li>
    <li>In the plugins menu inside XPlane, open Lnuxtrack and Linuxtrack Setup - 
    there should be a line saying: "PilotView plugin found, chanelling headtracking data through it!". </li>
</ul>
Should you encounter any problems getting this to work, please contact me first, to see if the problem is 
not on my side.
