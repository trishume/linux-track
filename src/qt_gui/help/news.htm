<h1>What's new?</h1>
<h2>Linuxtrack 1.0 Beta 3</h2>
<h3>New MacOSX package</h3>
After a long pause, caused by deep changes throughout the code and followed by a sudden departure 
of my good old Mac Mini, I've created new MacOSX package. 
<p>Please note, that I had to discontinue 
support for MacOSX 10.4 Tiger and 10.5 Leopard, along with PowerPC platform - the new packages will
be targetet towards MacOSX 10.6 Snow Leopard and up.
<h3>Improved 3D preview</h3>
The 3D preview model has been reworked - the cockpit should look much better now and also the
sky sphere should add a bit to the impression. Also the new visualization is much less resource 
hungry and should run well on low power devices (Atom powered netbooks, ...).
<h3>XPlane plugin cooperates with Pilotview</h3>
XPlane plugin now cooperates with Sandy Barbour's Pilotview plugin. Please reinstall the XPlane 
plugin to get this new functionality and don't forget to enable external data usage in Pilotview.
Please note, that you need Pilotview 1.70 to have this feature available.

<h2>Linuxtrack 1.0 Beta 2</h2>
<h3>Overhauled the pose computing</h3>
When using three point models, you can tweak them to minimize the unwanted viewpoint movement when
panning.
<h3>Wine bridge fix</h3>
Fixed problems in the wine bridge that prevented Condor soaring simulator and Falcon AF 
to respond to the tracking. If you experience such a problem, please reinstall the linuxtrack wine plugin.

<h2>Linuxtrack 1.0 Beta 1</h2>
This Linuxtrack release is the beginning of the Linuxtrack 1.0 Beta run. 

<h3>Linuxtrack requires wine now</h3>
If you use any device from NP (TrackIR, SmartNav4), you have to have wine installed in order to get
a firmware needed to run the device.
<p>
When the firmware is extracted, you might find TrackIR icon on your desktop - it is perfectly safe 
to remove it.
<p>
Technical info: wine is being used to unpack windows TrackIR driver and extract the firmware from it.
The extraction takes place in a temporary wine prefix, that is removed when done.

<h3>64bit XPlane plugin</h3>
Linuxtrack now contains 64bit enabled XPlane plugin - it should work in both XPlane 9 and XPlane 10
32 and 64 bit.

<h3>Linuxtrack supports Wine games now</h3>
By installing wine plugin, you enable linuxtrack usage in TrackIR enabled windows games.
For now, 32bit games are supported only, but 64bit will be worked on soon.

<h3>Linuxtrack preferences directory changed</h3>
Linuxtrack now stores its preferences in your home directory, under .config/linuxtrack directory.
That includes TrackIR firmware too...

<h3>Mickey, the virtual mouse</h3>
Linuxtrack contains a virtual mouse application called mickey. It allows you to use headtracking
instead of, or along with conventional mouse. For the moment, mickey works on linux only, but MacOS
version is planned soon.
