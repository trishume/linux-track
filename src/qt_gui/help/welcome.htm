<h1>Welcome to Linuxtrack!</h1>
First of all, thank you for using Linuxtrack, software that aims to bring headtracking 
to Linux and MacOS.
<p>
Linuxtrack allows you to use a webcamera, wiimote or any of supported NP devices 
(currently TrackIR2 to 5 and SmartNav4) as a headtracking device, facilitating view control 
in flight simulators or any other type of software. 
<p>
Applications utilizing Linuxtrack are for example XPlane flight simulator, 
FlightGear flight simulator, and any TrackIR enabled game running in wine (Condor soaring simulator,
Il-2, Falcon 4, ...).
<p>
If you want to know more, see the following pages:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.linuxtrack.eu" >Linuxtrack Project page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?act=idx" >XPlane.org Forums, namely its Linux forum</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.free-track.net/english/" >Freetrack project page - see for the model 
creation hints, tutorials and more</a></li>
</ul>

Should you encounter a bug, please file a bug report at the project page - not only it will 
allow me to fix the bug, but it also helps to improve Linuxtrack itself.
Also any comments, ideas for improvement and constructive criticism is very welcome!
