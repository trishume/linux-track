<h1>NP Firmware Extractor</h1>
Some NP devices (TrackIR4+ and SmartNav4) require a firmware that has to be loaded each time the device is
started. Also the Linuxtrack-Wine bridge utilizes some informations contained in the package
(the infamous poetry, list of supported games along with their IDs and keys for the "enhanced" interface).
The firmware is extracted using Wine from the TrackIR windows package downloaded directly from
NP.

<h2>Firmware extraction</h2>

<img src="Extractor.png" width="100%" alt="">
<p>
When the Extraction dialog pops up, press the <b>Download</b> button to download the latest 
driver package. By default the newest packge available is downloaded; if it is not accessible,
select any other from the combobox to the left of the button (all packages listed there contain 
the same firmware, only the game list might differ a bit) and try again.
<p>
When the package is downloaded/browsed to, a dialog containing short instructions pops up.
After pressing <b>OK</b> the package is installed to a temporary Wine prefix.
<p>
On Linux, usual installation dialog will pop up - just install the whole thing.
Newer packages contain some MS runtime and NP USB drivers install, both of them has to be installed
in order to install the main package. Don't worry though, none of the installed things is going to
last - when the data are extracted, everything is going to be removed (and the installation happens 
in temporary Wine prefix).
<p>
On Macs, due to Wine configuration pecularities, the installation should be performed silently.
<p>
When the installer finishes, the extraction is started - you can follow its progress in the status
part of the Extractor dialog. When the extraction is finished, the dialog closes by itself.
<p>
If you don't have access to the internet, just download any of the listed packages elsewhere and
using the <b>Extract from installer</b> button find and open the one you downloaded.
<p>
If you encounter any difficulties using the above methods, you can try to install the driver by 
hand (using Wine or install on windows machine and copy the result over). Then just press the 
<b>Extract from unpacked</b>, browse to the directory (the whole directory!) containing the
NP software (e.g. ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/NaturalPoint/TrackIR5) and press <b>Open</b> button for 
the extraction to begin.


<h2>Why so complicated?</h2>
Maybe you wander, why is the whole thing that complicated, or why to download ~20MB package instead
of 100KB one?
<p>
There are two main reasons that led to this decision:
<p>
The first one is the neglect from the NP's side - I asked couple of relatively simple questions 
(e.g. what is their take on Linuxtrack in Wine, ...), and after a year of waiting without any real answer,
I came to a conclusion that this is not a way to go. 
<p>
The second reason was their attempt to impose artificial limitations on the Linuxtrack itself
in order to grant me a permission to use SmartNav 4 firmware; they asked for disabling SmartNav4
functionality on MacOS, so people couldn't use Linuxtrack to emulate a mouse. Besides of 
being technicaly impossible to do (how a library can check what it is being used for), 
it would be completely against the Linuxtrack's spirit.
<p>
For those reasons (and couple of others) I decided to cut all the bonds (they used to host Linuxtrack
firmware package in the past - per their own request) and using Wine was the only logical choice.
Given the fact, that this step is mostly one time only, I hope the inconvenience level is not 
too high.

<h2>Technical informations</h2>
The extracted files are in the following path:

~/.config/linuxtrack/tir_firmware

and it contains the following files:
<ul>
<li><b>poem1.txt</b> The first haiku verse - so called DLL signature</li>
<li><b>poem2.txt</b> The second haiku verse - so called Application signature</li>
<li><b>gamedata.txt</b> List of TrackIR enhanced games along with their IDs</li>
<li><b>sn4.fw.gz</b> SmartNav4 firmware</li>
<li><b>tir4.fw.gz</b> TrackIR4 firmware</li>
<li><b>tir5.fw.gz</b> TrackIR5 firmware</li>
<li><b>tir5v2.fw.gz</b> TrackIR5 rev 2 firmware</li>
</ul>

The haiku verses are used by most games to verify that there is a TrackIR software on the other side.
It was used to prevent other programs from emulating the interface (most notably FreeTrack).
The claim was based on the fact, that those strings contain NP's trademark and they are copyrighted.
My belief is, that since most games refuse to work without it, it is a part of the interface and 
therefore not copyrightable in order to provide means of interoperability. Also Fair use should be 
aplicable in this case.
<p>
The gamedata.txt list is extracted from file sgl.dat; the file is encrypted using RC4 stream cipher,
using first 5 bytes in MD5 hash of string "NaturalPoint" as a key. The payload is XML, containing
data on supported games, of which the only relevant part is a game ID, its name and for games using the
"enhanced" interface there are communication keys. The Linuxtrack-Wine bridge uses this info to determine 
game's name when passed its ID and the keys to emulate the enhanced interface when necessary.
