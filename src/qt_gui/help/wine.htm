<h1>Linuxtrack - Wine</h1>
To allow Windows programs running under Wine to use headtracking, Linuxtrack provides Linuxtrac-Wine installer.
This installer provides necessary interfaces to channell headtracking data to both TrackIR enabled applications (both native like Condor Soaring, or via TIRViews.dll like MSFS series) and FreeTrack compatible applications.
Be aware, that Linuxtrack-Wine requires TrackIR firmware with companion files to be available (even if you aren't using the TrackIR for tracking).

<p>
Please note, that it is necessary to install TrackIr firmware (along with mfc42u.dll needed by TIRViews.dll) to utilize all of the above options. The easiest way to do that is to use the <strong>Install Linuxtrack-Wine support...</strong> button found on the Misc pane of the ltr_gui. That way, all the necessary components will be installed/extracted in one go.
<p>
On Linux, a dialogue asking for the target "Wine prefix" (or "bottle") pops up after you install the prerequisities - the Linuxtrack-Wine will be installed to the prefix/bottle of your choice.
<p>
On Mac OS X, the linuxtrack-wine.exe installer (located in the Linuxtrack .dmg package) must be
installed manually - just run the installer in the desired "bottle".
<p>
Please be aware that linuxtrack-wine.exe must be installed into each and every wine bottle/prefix in which you require the headtracking.

<p>
If you installed Linuxtrack-Wine prior to version 0.99.11, to gain access to the new features you need to uninstall it first, reinstall TrackIR firware (to get TIRViews.dll and mfc42u.dll) and then install the new linuxtrack-wine.exe.

<h2>Linuxtrack-wine usage</h2>
When you installed the Lnuxtrack-Wine to the bottle/prefix of your choice, there are several programs at your disposal.

<p>
<strong>Controller</strong> allows you to bind a hotkeys to pause/resume and recenter the trackng.
It can be minimized to the try so it doesn't clutter the desktop.
When a <b>Controller</b> is started, window pops up and you should specify the pause key and recenter key -
just press the appropriate button followed by key/keys of your choice (max 2 keys).
One thing to be aware of is, that the <strong>Controller</strong> works (meaning it sees the hotkey pressed) only inside the bottle/prefix where you installed it!
<p>

<p>
<strong>TrackIR</strong> is a fake TrackIR executable, that is required by certain games in order to accept the tracking data. It also loads TIRViews library, that channels the headtracking data into following games:
<ul>
<li>Battlefield 2
<li>Wings of War
<li>Nascar Racing Season 2003
<li>Collin McRae Rally 04
<li>ToCA Race Driver 2
<li>Richard Burns Rally
<li>F1 Challenge
<li>MSFS 2004, FSX
<li>CFS3
<li>Prepar3D
</ul>

<p>
<strong>FreeTrackTester</strong>, <strong>Tester</strong> (and on 64bit Wine also <strong>Tester64</strong>) allow you to troubleshoot the Linuxtrack-Wine installation. They are FreeTrack and TrackIR client applications and if they are working, the installation is OK.

<p>
Linuxtrack-Wine can also be uninstalled if necessary using the <strong>Uninstall</strong>.

<h2>Supported games</h2>
Technicaly speaking, any FreeTrack and/or TrackIR enabled game/application should work. Directly tested (meaning I tested them) were the following:

<ul>
<li>Falcon AF
<li>Condor Soaring simulator
<li>IL2
<li>MSFS 2004
</ul>

If you know of others (working or not; assuming the game itself work under wine), please let me know, so I can either assist you in troubleshooting or update the list.
