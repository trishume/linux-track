<h1>Tracking setup</h1>
When you have the tracking device and model set up, then you can proceed to the tracking 
customization.
Here you can set sensitivities, dead zones, nonlinearities and the amount of filtration for each
axis separately; you can also turn unwanted axes off, specify limits of each axis and so on...
All this can be done separately for each target program/game.

<h2>Default profile</h2>
The Default profile is quite special - when an unknown game/program is run for the first time,
the Default profile is copied over to the new profile. 

<h2>General setup</h2>
Make sure you have selcted the desired profile. 
Controls in the Tracking setup pane lets you do the following:

<ul>
  <li>Checkbox in the front allows you to enable/disable an axis.</li>
  <li>Sensitivity controlls allow you to change controll responsivenes - the higher the sensitivity is,
    the more responsive the particular axis will be.
  <li>Common smoothing slider allows you to set the amount of smoothing for all axes.</li>
  <li><b>Detailed axes setup</b> button opens a dialog allowing you to set all aspects of all the axes.</li>
  <li><b>Import profile</b> button imports all settings in the current profile from a file.</li>
  <li><b>Export profile</b> button exports current profile to a file.</li>
  <li><b>Copy from Default Profile</b> copies Default profile setup to the current profile.</li>
</ul> 
<p>
All the controlls have immediate effect on the tracking, so you can directly see the impact of 
the change. Also note, that while it is possible to run ltr_gui in parallel with a 
client program/game, it is not recommended. Tracking works without the GUI running, 
unlike other popular alternatives (NP, free-track, ...).
<p>
<h2>Detailed axes setup</h2>
When <b>Detailed axes setup</b> button is pressed, new dialog pops up allowing you to set all aspects of 
all axes. On the left side you can see a visualization of the current axis and its setup.

<p>
For both halves of an axis you can set an in-game limit of an axis and the curvature - nonlinearity
of the axis. There is also a <b>As Above</b> checkbox that allows you to unchain those halves and 
set each one separately.

<p>
You can also set the axis sensitivity, deadzone and amount of additional filtration.
<p>
The higher the sensitivity is, the smaller head movement will be necessary for tracking. 
Just be careful not to set it too high - it might result in a stiff neck, and other problems.
<p>
Deadzone allows you to specify size of the region around the center position, where the 
output is ignored.
<p>
Smoothing slider can be used to give that particular axis additional amount of smoothing. Please 
note that this doesn't affect other axes.
