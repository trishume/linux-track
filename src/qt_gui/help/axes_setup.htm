<h1>Tracking setup</h1>
When you have the device and model set up, then you can proceed to the tracking customization.
Here you can set sensitivities, dead zones, nonlinearities and the amount of filtration for each
axis separately; you can also turn unwanted axes off, specify limits of each axis and so on...
All this can be done separately for each target program/game.
<p>

<h2>Default profile concept</h2>
Default profile is quite special - when an unknown game/program is run for the first time,
the Default profile is used. Also new profile is created for you to allow you to customize 
the tracking only in that particular game/program.
<p>
This means, that the Default profile should be as generic as possible and only changes needed 
for particular game/program should be done in the specific profile.
<p>
Please note, that at first the new profile doesn't contain any data on its own, at first it fully reflects
the default profile; this means, that if you change something in the Default profile now, 
you'll see the change in the new profile as well.
<p>
However, whenever you change something in the new profile, the link is broken and the changed value
would no longer follow the Default profile anymore.

<h2>General setup</h2>
Make sure you have selcted the desired profile. 
Controlls in the Tracking setup pane lets you do the following:

<ul>
  <li>Checkbox in the front allows you to enable/disable an axis.</li>
  <li>Sensitivity controlls allow you to change controll responsivenes - the higher the number, the more 
    sensitive the particular axis will be. Some axes allow you to set both parts independently - that can
    be enabled in the <b>Detailed axes setup</b> dialog.</li>
  <li><b>Detailed axes setup</b> button opens a dialog allowing you to set all aspects of the axes.</li>
  <li><b>Filter Factor</b> slider lets you set amount of "smoothing" common for all axes.</li>
</ul> 
<p>
All the controlls have immediate effect on the tracking, so you can directly see the impact of the change.
Also note, that while it is possible to run ltr_gui in parallel with a client program/game, it is not 
recommended. Tracking works without the GUI running, unlike other popular alternatives (NP, free-track, ...).
<p>
<h2>Detailed axes setup</h2>
When <b>Detailed axes setup</b> button is pressed, new dialog pops up allowing you to set all aspects of 
all axes.
<ul>
<li><b>Symetrical</b> checkbox allows you to specify if the axis should be symetrical (changes on one side 
influence the other side too). For example back/forth movement should not be symetrical if you simulate being 
strapped to a chair, like in the cockpit, since your movement back is limited by the chair.</li>
<li><b>Sensitivity</b> dial changes the responsiveness of the selected axis. Usualy the value is between 3 and 5.</li>
<li><b>Limit</b> dial sets how much your simulated head can rotate/move.</li>
<li><b>Curvature</b> slider controlls the nonlinearity of the axis - 50% is linear; check the curve above the 
  controlls to see how the curve changes.</li>
<li><b>Dead zone</b> slider lets you specify a size of the area around the center, where the rotation/movement
  is ignored.</li>
<li><b>Additional filtration</b> slider allows you to increase the amount of smoothing applied to an axis.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Again, all the changes are effective immediately.
 
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
If the view is jumping unpredictably even when your head is still, check the sensitivities - a value higher than
say 5-7 is suspect. Try lowering the sensitivities and see if it helps.
<p>
It is possible that you'll experience a "pumping" effect - moving the view back and forth with no 
apparent reason. It is an inherent problem in the three point 3D pose 
tracking - Z axis (back/forth movement) is the least precise and is the most sensitive to small input changes
(especially on low resolution devices like TrackIR4). To get around this problem, use the 
<b>Edit sensitivity curves</b> button and set the Z axis filter factor higher or increase the dead zone 
(probably combination of both will yield the best results).
