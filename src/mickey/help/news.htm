<h1>What's new?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Mickey supports both relative mode (head movements control cursor speed) and absolute mode (head movements 
directly control position of the cursor).</li>
<li>Mickey employs sensitivity curve to adjust the tracking feel, allowing for greater precision when movement is 
small and high cursor speed for bigger movement.</li>
<li>All adjustments (centering, calibration, ...) are timed now and the timeouts are customizable.</li>
<li>Pausing/un-pausing shortcut is now customizable. The range of available hot-keys is not very wide, 
but covers seldom used keys. If you need a key that is not listed, please file a bug and it'll be added.</li>
</ul>
