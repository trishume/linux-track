<h1>Miscelaneous setup</h1>
<h2>Hotkey setup</h2>
Hotkey setup allows you to customize the hotkey for starting/stopping the tracking.
It covers some seldom used keys, that should be suitable for the purpose.
<p>
The hotkey allows you to select the hotkey and possibly a modifier (Ctrl, Alt, ...).
If the hotkey is not usable (e.g. it is already grabbed by another application), 
a warning messagebox pops up and the previous hotkey is reset.

<h2>Timeouts setup</h2>
To facilitate a hands free setup of Mickey, all the settings are timed - there is no need
to click any buttons.
<p>
<b>Centering timeout</b> specifies a time after the press of the <b>Recenter</b> button and
the actual center point registration. 
<p>
<b>Calibration timeout</b> is a time during which you are supposed to move your head to
left/right/top/bottom extremes (that are still usable for the tracking) during calibration. When the time is up,
the calibration is finished and the tracking is adjusted appropriately.
