<h1>Tracking setup</h1>
This part of the Mickey user interface allows you to set parameters of the tracking like cursor 
speed, deadzone and others.

<p>
<b>Sensitivity</b> slider allows you to set the top speed of the mouse cursor. Leftmost position
is the slowest, rightmost the fastest. Please note, that this setting doesn't change the sensitivity
curve visualization (the view is normalized to the sensitivity).

<p>
<b>Deadzone</b> slider specifies percentage of the full movement range (up to 50%) that is ignored 
and doesn't cause any cursor movement. It allows for neck muscle relaxation as it doesn't require
you to hold your head exactly centered to hold the cursor steady.

<p>
<b>Curvature</b> slider is used to modify the feel of the tracker; when moved to the right off 
the center position, the tracking is more precise around the center; when moved to the left,
the speed rises more abruptly allowing for faster, yet less precise cursor control.

<p>
<b>Step only</b> checkbox disables the <b>Curvature</b> slider and causes the cursor either stand
still (when inside the deadzone) or running the full speed in the direction of head movement.

<p>
<b>Apply changes</b> button allows you to check the new settings; when the result is unsatisfactory,
either click the <b>Revert changes</b> button or wait for the timeout to get back to the previous state.
If you like the settings, make sure you click the <b>Keep</b> button!

<p>
<b>Calibrate</b> button commences the calibration process. The first stage is the recentering - center 
your sight and wait for the timeout; the calibration itself is started next - before the time is up,
move your head to the left/right/top/bottom extremes. It allows the software to optimize the tracking
to the range of motion of your head.

<p>
<b>Recenter</b> button allows only to center the view without going through the full blown calibration.
