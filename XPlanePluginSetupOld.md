# Introduction #

This page explains howto setup the new XPlane plugin.

Please note, that if you used linuxtrack XPlane plugin before, you might need to reinstall the plugin using the linuxtrack GUI.

Setup of tracking parameters is done in the linuxtrack GUI, this page deals with setup of hotkeys and/or joystick buttons to control the tracking.

# Joystick buttons setup #

Joystick buttons are setup using _Buttons : Adv_ pane in the _Joystick & Equipment_ window, that is accesible through _Settings / Joystick, Keys & Equipment_ menu.

Please note the last three items in the right box - these are the three actions, that allow you to control the linuxtrack.

Now just press the desired joystick button, in the upper middle box select _view/_ and in the right box select the appropriate action.

Repeat those steps and when done, just close the window and the new bindings should be active.

# Keyboard bindings setup #

Keyboard bindings are setup pretty much in the same way - use _Keys_ pane in the _Joystick & Equipment_ window, that is accesible through _Settings / Joystick, Keys & Equipment_ menu.

Again note those three last items in the rightmost part of the window.

Just press button with the key of your choice in the leftmost part of the window,
and then select desired action to bind to (_view/_...).

You can also press _Add new key assignment_ button in the middle bottom, that will createnew key position - just press the newly created button and then press the key (or conbination) that you want to assign to it. Then again select the desired binding.

There is also a possibility to assign keys using plugin Hot Key manager, but this method is deprecated since it doesn't seem to make this change persistent (after Xplane restart you have to do the assignment again).
