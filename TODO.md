# Introduction #
This is a list of things that should be done

You can comment on that if you want me to add features/change priorities...

# Details #

**The current version is frozen (unless some serious bug is reported). The development is done in a separate branch so noone suffers when I break something.**
**Those changes I announced earlier are going well for now... Client/server concept is implemented, dynamic libraries too. Now the Gui is on the way.**

Converting linuxtrack into dynamic library + add static part to facilitate its usage (DONE)

Pose should be recomputed when frame is received, not when app asks... (DONE)

GUI - Qt (working on it)

Wiimote and webcam support for Macs. (Proof of concept showed that current architecture is not going to work well)

Tracking library interface consolidation (very soon)

Add udev rule template (Next thing to do)

Track IR4 sensitivity control (Planned soon)

Track IR5 full support (basic TIR5 support done, working on camera controls implementation)

Add deadzones and sensitivity curves (request received, as soon as GUI is ready)

Create dedicated plugin for 9.X version of XPlane (Moved higher, it would make joystick usage less complicated)

Add support for games under Wine (Proof of concept working)

Revise the whole project, add comments... (When time permits)
