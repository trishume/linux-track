## I do have a question and it is not answered here... ##
If you have a question that is not here that you think it deserves to be here, just post it as a comment and we'll add it here along with an answer.

## Why is linuxtrack 32bit only? ##
As of now, linuxtrack is 32bit only, since its proof-of-concept platform (XPlane simulator) is 32bit only. It also helps to narrow the early stages of development - no 32 versus 64 bit problems...

In the future, the plan is to introduce both 32 and 64 bit library (for AMD64 architecture) and to find a way to correctly choose which one to use.
